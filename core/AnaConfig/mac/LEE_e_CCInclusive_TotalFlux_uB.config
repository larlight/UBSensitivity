#Guidelines for writing config files so ConfigReader can handle them
# (0) Comments only at beginning of line, marked with # character.
# (1) Single word lines ending with colon correspond to individual modules.
# (2) Blank lines don't matter.
# (3) Blank parameter values after the parameter name signify "use default".
# (4) Spaces in parameter values are ok; it's all added together to make
#      string (I.E. a histogram title). Don't need quotes.
# (5) Arrays should be written like: [3,1,4.4, 5.23].
#       --Spaces are OK. All elements cast a doubles.
#       --Must be surrounded by square brackets [].
